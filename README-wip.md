Storage-viz, visualize Mongo's storage and indexes
==================================================

Authors: Andrea Lattuada

The commands used by this tool are currently EXPERIMENTAL and UNSUPPORTED.

Storage-viz is a suite of web-based visualizers that leverage new database commands:
they make it easier to understand and analyze MongoDB storage and btree layout.

OVERVIEW
--------

The `storageDetails` command will aggregate statistics related to the
storage layout (when invoked with `analyze: "diskStorage"`) or the percentage
of pages currently in RAM (when invoked with `analyze: "pagesInRAM"`) for the
specified collection, extent or part of extent.

The `indexStats` command provides detailed and aggregate information and
statistics for the underlying btree of a particular index.
Stats are aggregated for the entire tree, per-depth and, if requested through
the `expandNodes` option, per-subtree.

Both commands take a global READ_LOCK and will page in all the extents or btree
buckets encountered: this will have adverse effects on server performance.
The commands should never be run on a primary and will cause a secondary to
fall behind on replication. `diskStorage` when run with
`analyze: "pagesInRAM"` is the exception as it typically returns rapidly and
may only page in extent headers.

USAGE
-----

To use the visualizers you need a recent MongoDB nightly.

Start mongod with the following command line switches:

    --rest --jsonp

and, depending on which command you'd like to use,

    --enableExperimentalStorageDetailsCmd
or

    --enableExperimentalIndexStatsCmd

NOTE: running mongod with these options is unsafe and not advisable for
production servers. Moreover --rest --jsonp allows anyone on the same
network as the server to invoke commands and query or modify data.

If you'd like to run the commands directly within the shell, helpers are
available.

Json output:

    db.collection.diskStorageStats({...})
    db.collection.pagesInRAM({...})
    db.collection.indexStats({index: "index name", ...})

To learn about command parameters take a look at the [](command reference) wiki page.

Their human-readable counterparts follow. They take the same parameters.

    db.collection.getDiskStorageStats()
    db.collection.getPagesInRAM()
    db.collection.getIndexStats()

The *visualizers* provide a nicer graphical representation but are very early stage
and have only been tested in Chrome.
The source code for them is available in this repository.

and usage.

[https://10gen-labs.github.com/storage-viz/indexStats.html] shows statistics related
to the indexing btrees.

[https://10gen-labs.github.com/storage-viz/pagesInRAM.html] reports which parts of a
collection is currently in ram.
